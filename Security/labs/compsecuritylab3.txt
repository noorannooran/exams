IP spoofing with Hping3
spoofing in kali linux

- run windows 7 vm with all firewalls disabled

command to use in kali linux:

	wireshark up and running in windows
	applications>Sniffing>Wireshark>Start

check that linux can ping windows ip
hping3 -S [ip-address]

check wireshark for SYN flag
hping3 -S [ip-address] -a [fakeip]

check wireshark in windows to see if fake ip is being used

LAB 3B
ARP poisoning
- taking server macaddress and replacing it with yours
	- when someone sends a message to the server
	- it sends the packets to you "man in the middle"


Lab 3b start

log in as administrator on windows 7, swindows server, linux root

cmd prompt in windows 7
	- delete the arp cache
arp -d *

same with windows server

arp -a
check mac address

next:
windows server:
delete arp cache

linux:
attack!
Applications> Sniffinf and spoofing> ethercap graphic
sniff > sniffing
Hosts> scan for host
will see the ip addresses of windows 7 and windows server
- make sure you know which ip is which

Add to target 1, add to target 2
Mitm > Sniff remote connections > ok


back to server
check arp cache

Lab 3c
Man in the middle
using ARP poisoning
change the MAC address of a server to an attacker's MAC address


physical address:
default gateway windows server
00-50-56-f0-0b-de
