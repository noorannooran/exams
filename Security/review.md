Midterm Review
## Introdution to Security
- challenges of securing info
- define security and why its important
- common types of attacks
- basic steps of attacks
- 5 basic principles of defense

### Challenges of Securing Information
1. Universally connected devices
- speed of attacks
- availability and simplicity of attack
- delays in security updates
- distributed attacks
- greater sophistication of attacks
- faster detection of vulnerabilities
- weak security update distribution
- BYOD & User confusion

#### Note
- the more convenient, the less secure

### Definition of Security
1. Confidentiality
   - authorized parties access information
2. Integrity
   - correct information, no alteration
3. Availability
   - accessible to **authorized** users
4. Authentication
   - genuine person **not** imposter
6. Accounting
   - tracking of events

#### Types of Attackers
- Cybercriminals
  - launch attacks against users
- Script Kiddies
  - limited knowledge of computer and network
- Brokers
  - uncover vulnerabilities and auction them off
- Insiders
  - employees, contractors, business partnets
- Cyberterrorists
  - ideologically motivated
- Hactivists
- State-sponsored attacks
  - spying on citizens, disrupt governments
  
### Basic Steps to an Attack
**Kill chain**: systematic process to target and engage an enemy
1. Reconnaisance
   - probe for information about the system
- Weaponization
   - create an exploit (e.g. virus) -> payload
- Delivery
  - email attachment/ through server
- Exploitation
  - triggers intruder's exploit
- Installation
  - installed to attack, or install a backdoor
- Command and control
  - remotely controlled by attacker
- Action on objectives

### Defending
1. Layering
   - several methods of protection
   - e.g. Crown Jewels
	 - layer 1 protective casing
	 - layer 2 special room with sensors
	 - layer 3 monitored by video cameras
	 - layer 4 surrounded by security guards
- Limiting
  - authorized personnel only
- Diversity
  - layers of defense must be **diverse**
- Obscurity
  - e.g. obscuring security guard shift changes
- Simplicity
  - e.g. guards do not understand how the other defenses work

### Importance of Security
- prevent data theft
- prevent identity theft
- avoid consequences of not securing information
- maintaining productivity
- foil cyberterrorism

## Malware & Social Engineering Attacks
- define malware
- types of malware
- payloads of malware
- types of social engineering psychological attacks
- social enginerring physical attacks

### Malware
- software that enters a system without the user's knowledge or consent that performs an unwanted/ harmful action

### Types of Malware
1. Circulation
   - spreading rapidly
2. Infection
   - infext/ embed self into system
- Concealment
  - avoid detection
- Payload capabilities
  - stealing password/ getting user data
  
#### Circulation
- Viruses
  - reproduces itself automatically on **host** computer
  - cannot spread by itself
  - can infect a file
- Worms
  - primary purpose to **spread** from computer to computer
  - aka NETWORK VIRUSES
  - cannot infect a file
- Trojans
  - exe masquerading as another activity
  - with the user's knowledge, malicious payload
  - can infect a file

#### Concealment
- **rootkit** hide the actions or presence of other types of software
- e.g. through music cds

#### Payload Capabilities
- collect data:
  - Spyware
  - Adware
	- can track user's activities and send to third parties
  - Ransomware
  - keylogger (software or hardware)
	- capture keystrokes, capture screen caps
- delete data
  - **logic bomb** code that lies dormant until triggered
- modify security settings
  - **backdoor** gives access to computer, program, service
- launch attacks
  - allows computer to be placed under remote control
  - **zombie** infected computer
  - **botnet** collection of zombies
	- under control of **bot herder**

### Social Engineering Psychological Approaches
- gathering information for an attack
- impersonation
- phishing:
  - pharming: redirects user to fake site
  - spear phishing: specific users
  - whaling: e.g. CEOs
  - vishing: telephone call
- spam
  - unsolicited emails
  - image spam cannot be filtered
- hoax
  - false warning e.g. from IT department
- typo squatting
  - near- URLS e.g. goggle.com
- watering hole
  - smaller group of specific individuals
  - id common website and infect with malware

#### Social Engineering Tactics
1. Authority
- Intimidation
- Concensus/ social proof
- Scarcity
- Urgency
- Familiarity/ Liking
- Trust

#### Physical Social Engineering Tactics
1. Dumpster diving
- Tailgating
  - authorized person opens the door, anyone can follow
- Shoulder surfing

## Quiz 1 A&A

1. What type of malware is heavily dependent on a user in order to spread?
   - virus
-  What term is used to describe a means of gathering information for an attack by relying on the weakness of individuals?
   - social enginerring
- WHat is the term used to describe unsoclicited messages received on instant messaging software?
  - 
- Select the term for individuals who want to attack computers yet lack the knowledge of computers and networks needed to do so
  - Script Kiddies

#### Match the following with the appropriate definitions
- A software program that delivers advertising content in a manner that is unexpected and unwanted
  - Adware
- Computer code that lies dormant until it is triggered by a specific logical event
  - logic bomb
- A logical computer network of zombies under the control of an attacker
  - botnet
- A false warning designed to trick users into changing security settings on their computer
  - hoax
- A phishing attack that using telephone calls instead of emails
  - vishing/ voice phishing
- Software code that gives access to a program or service circumventing normal security protections
  - Trojan
- Computer virus written in a script known as macro
  - macro virus
- Software or hardware device that captures and stores each keystroke that a user types
  - keylogger
- phishing attack that targets specific users
  - spear phishing

  - computer virus

### Q&A continued
- In information security, what constitutes a loss?
  - loss of information
  - financial loss due to time
  - loss of reputation
- One of the armoured virus infection techniques utililizes encryption to make virus code more difficult to detect, in addition to separating virus code into different pieces and injecting throughout the infected program code. what is the name for this technique?
  - Swiss Cheese

### True or False
- Spreading similarly to a virus, a worm inserts itself malicious into a program or data file
  - False
