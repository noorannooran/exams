## Introdution to Security
- challenges of securing info
- define security and why its important
- common types of attacks
- basic steps of attacks
- 5 basic principles of defense

### Challenges of Securing Information
1. Universally connected devices
- speed of attacks
- availability and simplicity of attack
- delays in security updates
- distributed attacks
- greater sophistication of attacks
- faster detection of vulnerabilities
- weak security update distribution
- BYOD & User confusion

#### Note
- the more convenient, the less secure

### Definition of Security
1. Confidentiality
   - authorized parties access information
2. Integrity
   - correct information, no alteration
3. Availability
   - accessible to **authorized** users
4. Authentication
   - genuine person **not** imposter
6. Accounting
   - tracking of events

#### Types of Attackers
- Cybercriminals
  - launch attacks against users
- Script Kiddies
  - limited knowledge of computer and network
- Brokers
  - uncover vulnerabilities and auction them off
- Insiders
  - employees, contractors, business partnets
- Cyberterrorists
  - ideologically motivated
- Hactivists
- State-sponsored attacks
  - spying on citizens, disrupt governments
  
### Basic Steps to an Attack
**Kill chain**: systematic process to target and engage an enemy
1. Reconnaisance
   - probe for information about the system
- Weaponization
   - create an exploit (e.g. virus) -> payload
- Delivery
  - email attachment/ through server
- Exploitation
  - triggers intruder's exploit
- Installation
  - installed to attack, or install a backdoor
- Command and control
  - remotely controlled by attacker
- Action on objectives

### Defending
1. Layering
   - several methods of protection
   - e.g. Crown Jewels
	 - layer 1 protective casing
	 - layer 2 special room with sensors
	 - layer 3 monitored by video cameras
	 - layer 4 surrounded by security guards
- Limiting
  - authorized personnel only
- Diversity
  - layers of defense must be **diverse**
- Obscurity
  - e.g. obscuring security guard shift changes
- Simplicity
  - e.g. guards do not understand how the other defenses work

### Importance of Security
- prevent data theft
- prevent identity theft
- avoid consequences of not securing information
- maintaining productivity
- foil cyberterrorism

## Malware & Social Engineering Attacks
- define malware
- types of malware
- payloads of malware
- types of social engineering psychological attacks
- social enginerring physical attacks

### Malware
- software that enters a system without the user's knowledge or consent that performs an unwanted/ harmful action

### Types of Malware
1. Circulation
   - spreading rapidly
2. Infection
   - infext/ embed self into system
- Concealment
  - avoid detection
- Payload capabilities
  - stealing password/ getting user data
