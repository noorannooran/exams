# Midterm Review
## Lecture 8 : Session Handling

### Purpose
- keep a record of previous site information for client

### How it works
1. User sends data
2. Web Container sends request to a new thread of the servlet
3. thread finds session associated with User 
4. Servlet runs logic and returns a response

5. user A submits
6. Cntainer sends request to a new thread of servlet
7. Thread finds session, stores the answers as an attribute

8. User B enters data
9. Container sends request to a new thread
10. The thread starts a new sesion for User B and stores answers data


### Maintaining Client Server session state
1. Cookies
   - session ID
   - not all browser support cookies
2. Hidden form fields
   - hidden html form with sessionId
   - not all html elements > submit
3. URL rewriting
   - generate every URL dynamically
4. HttpSession Object
   - HttpSession interface
	 - good
