## Lecture 3 : Handling the Client Request- Form Data
### HTTP GET VS POST

### GET
- simplest
- ask server to GET a resource and send it back
- HTML, jpeg, PDF, etc

### POST
- can send user data
- GET+
- allow caller to request something, send form data to server

#### More
- can send info with GET
  - in the URL for example
  
### GET
#### PROS
- URLs bookmarked safely
- reloaded safely
- browser can cache results
- easier to test interactively

#### CONS
- security risk: variables are sent through url
- limited variables can be passed through = 2048 max

### POST
#### PROS
- security : not displayed in URL
- unlimited number
- URL is simpler
- special characters can be sent
- browser will not cache results

#### CONS
- page cannot be bookmarked
- performance response degraded
