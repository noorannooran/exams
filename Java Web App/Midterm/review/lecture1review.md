#### JSP VS JSF 2
#### JSP
	- standard
	- used by google, ebay, Walmart
	- low- level
#### JSF2 vrsion 2
	- Java EE
	- higher level
	  - integrated Ajax support
	  - field validation
	  - page templating
	  - third party component libraries
	  - MVC architexture

#### When to use which
#### JSP
	- maintaining and extending legacy projects
#### Servlet only
	- apps with front ends that do no use server side framework
	- servlets handle Ajax request from jquery, do not build pages
#### JSF2
- new projects, dynamic pages
- rich component toolkit
